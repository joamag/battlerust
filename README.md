# Battlerust ü¶Ä + üõ•Ô∏è

A Battleship game implementation in Rust ü¶Ä.

## Challenge

Create an application to allow a single human player to play a one-sided game of Battleships against ships placed by the computer.

The program should create a 10x10 grid, and place a number of ships on the grid at random with the following sizes:

* 1x Battleship (5 squares)
* 2x Destroyers (4 squares)

The player enters coordinates of the form ‚ÄúA5‚Äù, where "A" is the column and "5" is the row, to specify a square to target. Shots result in hits, misses or sinks. The game ends when all ships are sunk.

## Build & Run

### Native

```bash
cargo build
cargo run
```

### WASM for Node.js

```bash
cargo install wasm-pack
wasm-pack build --release --target=nodejs -- --features wasm
```

### WASM with WASI

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-wasi
cargo build --release  --target wasm32-wasi
cd target/wasm32-wasi/release
wasmtime battlerust.wasm
```

## WASM Console

You can use [WebAssembly.sh](https://webassembly.sh) to play around with the [WASI](https://wasi.dev/) compliant [WASM](https://webassembly.org/) assembly and interact with this Web shell in the same way as you would in your normal OS shell.

In alternative you can use the [Wasmtime](https://wasmtime.dev) WASM runtime to run the WASM binary in your local computer.
